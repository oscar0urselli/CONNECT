# CONNECT
I don't have a name to use, so I'm using this. :)

Basically this project, instantiate a TCP communication between two or more devices. One of these will be the Server (a normal pc that can run the program) and the others the clients (for this project an Android phone). Clients send commands or messages to the server, which will use to control a slave device connected to it (in this case Arduino with a serial communication).
